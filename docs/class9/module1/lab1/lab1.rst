Exercise 1.1: Policy Creation
----------------------------------
Objective
~~~~~~~~~

- Create a transparent rapid deployment policy.

- Enable application security logging profile.

- Validate that both the policy and logging profile are working.

- Configure Geolocation and review logs

- Configure IP Intelligence and review logs

- Estimated time for completion: **30** **minutes**.

.. NOTE:: If the Operating system prompts you to update system software, please decline

#. RDP to the the jumpbox, launch Chrome click the BIG-IP bookmark and login to TMUI. admin/F5LabDays!


Please ensure that four virtual servers are configured before you begin:

- ``DVWA_protected_virtual``
- ``DVWA_unprotected_virtual``
- ``Hackazon_protected_virtual``
- ``JSON_virtual``

#. Click on the **Create New Policy** button. The policy creation wizard opens.

#. Click on the **Advanced** button (Top-Right) to ensure that all the available policy creation options are displayed.

#. Name the security policy ``lab1_dvwa_waf`` and notice that the **Policy Type** is security.

#. Verify the **Policy Template** is set to ``Rapid Deployment Policy`` and notice it is a transparent security policy by default

#. Assign this policy to the ``DVWA_unprotected_virtual`` from the Virtual Server drop down.

#. Confirm that the Application Language is set to **UTF-8**.

#. Accept the remaining default policy settings and click **Create Policy** to complete the policy creation process.

.. Note:: After policy creation is complete, the properties will be displayed for review within the Policies List menu.

**Your settings should reflect the figures below:**

**Question:** Would logging all requests and responses in a production environment be a best practice?

**Answer:** This adds 50% or more to the overhead on the log engine and would not typically be used outside of troubleshooting or high security environments that are appropriately sized.


Apply WAF Logging Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Under **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**, click on ``webgoat.f5demo.com_https_vs``.
#. Click on **Policies** under the **Security** tab at the top of the ``webgoat.f5demo.com_https_vs`` details menu.
#. In the **Log Profile** drop down menu, select ``Enabled...``
#. Within the **Available** logging profiles menu, select ``waf_allrequests`` and then click the **<<** arrows to move the logging policy to the **Selected** profile.
#. Click on the Update button to apply the policy.

2. Login using **f5student/f5DEMOs4u!** credentials and interact with the webgoat application by browsing. Please refrain from experimenting with the site using any familiar "exploit" techniques.

#. On the BIG-IP, navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Application > Requests**.

#. Clear the default **"Illegal Requests"** filter by clicking the x.

        .. image:: images/image8.PNG
          :width: 600 px

#. Verify that requests are being logged by the WAF. You should be able to see both the raw client requests and server responses.

Exercise 1.2: Geolocation and IP Intelligence
-------------------------------------------------
Geolocation
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open **Security > Application Security > Geolocation Enforcement**

#. Select all geolocations **except the United States and N/A** and move
   them to Disallowed Geolocations. **Save** and then **Apply Policy**.

   .. NOTE:: N/A covers all RFC1918 addresses. If you aren’t dropping them
      at your border router (layer 3), you may decide to geo-enforce at
      ASM (Layer 7) if no private IP’s will be accessing the site.

   .. image:: images/image10.PNG
    :width: 600 px

   .. IMPORTANT:: Remember to click on the **Apply Policy** button (top right) to commit security policy changes.

#. Open **Local Traffic > iRules** and open the iRule titled
   ``webgoat_irule`` and review the code.

   .. code-block:: tcl
      :linenos:

      when HTTP_REQUEST {
         HTTP::header replace X-Forwarded-For "[expr (int(rand()*221)+1)].[expr int(rand()*254)].[expr int(rand()*254)].[expr int(rand()*254)]"
      }

   .. NOTE:: The above iRule is essentially scanning the HTTP headers and when
      it finds the ``X-Forwarded-For`` header it will replace the original source
      IP address with a randomized IP address. Since we are only manipulating
      the header this has no discernable affect on traffic flow. This iRule
      event, ``when HTTP_REQUEST``, also fires before the ASM policy allowing
      this "trick" to work to demonstrate a global range of source IP
      addresses.

#. Open **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and click on ``webgoat.f5demo.com_https_vs``. Go to the **Resources**
   horizontal tab and click on **Manage** in the **iRules** section.

   .. image:: images/image11.PNG
    :width: 600 px

#. Select the ``webgoat_irule``, move it to the **Enabled** assignment and
   click **Finished**.

   .. image:: images/image12.PNG
       :width: 600 px

6. We now need to tell ASM to trust the XFF header by turning on the **Trust XFF Header** feature in the policy.
Navigate to **Application Security > Policy > Policy Properties** and hit the dropdown for **Advanced View**.
You can now check the box to **Trust XFF Header** and click **Save** then **Apply Policy**

.. image:: images/image15.PNG
    :width: 600 px

.. NOTE:: Regarding Trust XFF - you would do this if ASM is deployed behind an internal or other trusted proxy. Then, the system uses the IP address that initiated the connection to the proxy instead of the internal proxy’s IP address. This option is useful for logging, web scraping, anomaly detection, and the geolocation feature.

**You should not configure trusted XFF headers if you think the HTTP header may be spoofed, or crafted, by a malicious client.**


#. Open a new **Google Chrome Private Browsing** window and connect to
   ``https://webgoat.f5demo.com/WebGoat/login``. Login and select a few links on the WebGoat page.

#. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Application > Requests**.

.. image:: images/image13.PNG
    :width: 600 px

Notice the geolocation detected and the presence of the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) in the Request details. Your actual client IP is still 10.1.10.28 however, because we trusted the XFF header and the iRule is randomizing the IP address placed in that header so ASM believes the request is from an external location. Depending on your network you may be leveraging a technology that creates a source NAT ahead of ASM. So by leveraging the XFF header, you can work around this and get contextual information about the client.

.. IMPORTANT:: Please remove the iRule ``webgoat_irule`` from the
   Virtual Server before proceeding.

IP Reputation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate to **Security > Application Security > IP Addresses > IP Intelligence** and click **Enabled**.
For all categories **select Alarm**. Click on **Save** and then on **Apply Policy**.

.. NOTE:: On the top right you should see that your IP Intelligence database has been updated at some point.

.. image:: images/image14.PNG
    :width: 600 px

.. NOTE:: In order to create traffic with malicious sources for the purposes of this lab we have created another special configuration item for you.

There is an iRule that you will apply to the ``webgoat.f5demo.com_https_vs`` virtual server.
This iRule will insert an X-Forward-For header with the value of a malicious United States source IP address. (Remember US is an allowed Geolocation)

1. Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Server > Virtual Servers List** and select the
      ``webgoat.f5demo.com_https_vs`` virtual server.

2. Navigate to the **Resources** tab and click **Manage** for the **iRules** section.

3. Move the **ip_rep_irule** irule to the **Enabled** pane of the **Resource Management** configuration and Click **Finished**.

        .. image:: images/image16.PNG
            :width: 600 px

4. Open a new private browsing window in Google Chrome and use the bookmark for **WebGoat** to browse the site. Login and Click on one or two items.

5. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Application > Requests** and review the log entries. Since you configured IP Intelligence violations to alarm you will not need to change the filter. Select the most recent entry and examine why the request is illegal. What IP address did the request come from?

        .. image:: images/image22.PNG
            :width: 600 px


        .. NOTE:: For more information click on the violation hyperlink to see the IPI category that this IP belongs to. You can also click "All Details" at the top right.


        .. image:: images/image24.PNG

**Bonus:** You can browse to ``http://www.brightcloud.com/tools/url-ip-lookup.php``
and look up the IP address in question for further information. There is also
a tool to report IP addresses that have been incorrectly flagged.

Further, you can ssh to the BIG-IP and login with ``root`` / ``f5DEMOs4u!`` to run
the ``iprep_lookup`` command, similar to:

[root@bigip1.Active.Standalone] config # **iprep_lookup 8.33.184.254**

iprep_lookup 8.33.184.254
opening database in /var/IpRep/F5IpRep.dat
size of IP reputation database = 37026703
iprep threats list for ip = 8.33.184.254 is:
bit 7 - Phishing
