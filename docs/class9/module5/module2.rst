Module – Credential Stuffing
============================

In this lab we will configure and test the Brute Force Mitigation
features in F5 ASM to mitigate various Credential Stuffing attacks. The
purpose of this lab is to learn how and why ASM detects a given
credential stuffing attack based on a given entity (username, IP
address, or DeviceID) or a widely distributed attack. Also, to show how
ASM detects the use of “known stolen credentials” in a credential
stuffing attack.
