Module â€“ Credential Protection
==============================

Because so many people use the same password on multiple sites, hackers are constantly looking for ways to steal users credentials to ANY web site
in hopes that those credentials will work to login to another web site, such as a bank account or valuable asset. One of the most commons ways threat
hackers use to steal credentials is malware that runs in the user's browser steals data anytime that user POST data to a URL, as is the case
when a user is logging in to a website.  This is called "man-in-the-browser" (MITB) malware.

In this lab we will look at methods used by MITB malware to steal users' credentials and other information.
